Key Points: 
- Donkeys increase at every level. 
- Colored Output
- Fireballs can be made to appear randomly or with some ai with very less change in code.
- When user completes a level, i.e. resques the princess, Score remains intact but Coins Collected changes back to 0(to show how many coinse were collected in this level.)
- getPosition(), checkWall(), checkCollision() ((Implemented as checkBlocking()), collectCoin() were implemented
- I could not take simontaneous input for jump. So you will need to press space first then the direction in which you want to jump
